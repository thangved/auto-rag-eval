We consider stability concepts for random matchings where agents have preferences over objects and objects have priorities for the agents. When matchings are deterministic, the standard stability concept also captures the fairness property of no (justified) envy. When matchings can be random, there are a number of natural stability / fairness concepts that coincide with stability / no envy whenever matchings are deterministic. We formalize known stability concepts for random matchings for a general setting that allows weak preferences and weak priorities, unacceptability, and an unequal number of agents and objects. We then present a clear taxonomy of the stability concepts and identify logical relations between them. Furthermore, we provide no envy / claims interpretations for some of the stability concepts that are based on a consumption process interpretation of random matchings.

Machine reading comprehension methods that generate answers by referring to multiple passages for a question have gained much attention in AI and NLP communities. The current methods, however, do not investigate the relationships among multiple passages in the answer generation process, even though topics correlated among the passages may be answer candidates. Our method, called neural answer Generation through Unified Memories over Multiple Passages (GUM-MP), solves this problem as follows. First, it determines which tokens in the passages are matched to the question. In particular, it investigates matches between tokens in positive passages, which are assigned to the question, and those in negative passages, which are not related to the question. Next, it determines which tokens in the passage are matched to other passages assigned to the same question and at the same time it investigates the topics in which they are matched. Finally, it encodes the token sequences with the above two matching results into unified memories in the passage encoders and learns the answer sequence by using an encoder-decoder with a multiple-pointer-generator mechanism. As a result, GUM-MP can generate answers by pointing to important tokens present across passages.

The problem of estimating subjective visual properties (SVP) of images (e.g., Shoes A is more comfortable than B) is gaining rising attention.

Therefore, recent investigations turn to collect pairwise comparisons via crowdsourcing platforms. However, crowdsourcing data usually contains outliers. For this purpose, it is desired to develop a robust model for learning SVP from crowdsourced noisy annotations. In this paper, we construct a deep SVP prediction model which not only leads to better detection of annotation outliers but also enables learning with extremely sparse annotations. Specifically, we construct a comparison multi-graph based on the collected annotations, where different labeling results correspond to edges with different directions between two vertexes.

In this paper, we provide an empirical study of the regularization effect of these training techniques on DNN optimization. Specifically, we find that the optimization trajectories of successful DNN trainings consistently obey a certain regularity principle that regularizes the model update direction to be aligned with the trajectory direction. Theoretically, we show that such a regularity principle leads to a convergence guarantee in nonconvex optimization and the convergence rate depends on a regularization parameter. Empirically, we find that DNN trainings that apply the training techniques achieve a fast convergence and obey the regularity principle with a large regularization parameter, implying that the model updates are well aligned with the trajectory.

This paper examines patch uplift operations at Mozilla, with the aim to identify the characteristics of uplifted patches that introduce regressions. Through statistical and manual analyses, we quantitatively and qualitatively investigate the reasons behind patch uplift decisions and the characteristics of uplifted patches that introduced regressions. Additionally, we interviewed three Mozilla release managers to understand organizational factors that affect patch uplift decisions and outcomes. Results show that most patches are uplifted because of a wrong functionality or a crash.

It does not use all available predictions (A is incorrect), nor rely only on single-step predictions (C is incorrect). The optimal W increases with slower environment variation despite lower prediction accuracy (B is incorrect)."}, "56": {"documentation": {"title": "Okapi: Causally Consistent Geo-Replication Made Faster, Cheaper and More\n  Available", "source": "Diego Didona, Kristina Spirovska, Willy Zwaenepoel", "docs_id": "1702.04263", "section": ["cs.DC"], "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "date": "N/A", "text": "Okapi: Causally Consistent Geo-Replication Made Faster, Cheaper and More\n  Available. Okapi is a new causally consistent geo-replicated key- value store. Okapi leverages two key design choices to achieve high performance. First, it relies on hybrid logical/physical clocks to achieve low latency even in the presence of clock skew. Second, Okapi achieves higher resource efficiency and better availability, at the expense of a slight increase in update visibility latency. To this end, Okapi implements a new stabilization protocol that uses a combination of vector and scalar clocks and makes a remote update visible when its delivery has been acknowledged by every data center. We evaluate Okapi with different workloads on Amazon AWS, using three geographically distributed regions and 96 nodes. We compare Okapi with two recent approaches to causal consistency, Cure and GentleRain. We show that Okapi delivers up to two orders of magnitude better performance than GentleRain and that Okapi achieves up to 3.5x lower latency and a 60% reduction of the meta-data overhead with respect to Cure."}, "answer": " Question: Based on the documentation, which of the following statements is true about Okapi?\n\nA) Okapi uses only physical clocks to achieve low latency in the presence of clock skew.\n\nB) Okapi relies on a combination of vector and scalar clocks for its stabilization protocol. \n\nC) Okapi makes a remote update visible only after it has been acknowledged by a majority of data centers.\n\nD) Okapi achieves worse resource efficiency and availability compared to other systems like Cure.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The documentation states that Okapi uses hybrid logical/physical clocks to achieve low latency with clock skew.

We examine the problem of allocating a given total storage budget in a distributed storage system for maximum reliability. A source has a single data object that is to be coded and stored over a set of storage nodes; it is allowed to store any amount of coded data in each node, as long as the total amount of storage used does not exceed the given budget. A data collector subsequently attempts to recover the original data object by accessing only the data stored in a random subset of the nodes. By using an appropriate code, successful recovery can be achieved whenever the total amount of data accessed is at least the size of the original data object. The goal is to find an optimal storage allocation that maximizes the probability of successful recovery. This optimization problem is challenging in general because of its combinatorial nature, despite its simple formulation. We study several variations of the problem, assuming different allocation models and access models. The optimal allocation and the optimal symmetric allocation (in which all nonempty nodes store the same amount of data) are determined for a variety of cases. Our results indicate that the optimal allocations often have nonintuitive structure and are difficult to specify.

Single image de-raining is an extremely challenging problem since the rainy image may contain rain streaks which may vary in size, direction and density. Previous approaches have attempted to address this problem by leveraging some prior information to remove rain streaks from a single image. One of the major limitations of these approaches is that they do not consider the location information of rain drops in the image. The proposed Uncertainty guided Multi-scale Residual Learning (UMRL) network attempts to address this issue by learning the rain content at different scales and using them to estimate the final de-rained output. In addition, we introduce a technique which guides the network to learn the network weights based on the confidence measure about the estimate. Furthermore, we introduce a new training and testing procedure based on the notion of cycle spinning to improve the final de-raining performance.
